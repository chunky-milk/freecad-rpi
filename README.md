# FreeCAD for Raspberry Pi
FreeCAD is a free and open-source parametric modeler. 

The original FreeCAD in the Raspberry Pi Foundation repositories is outdated. I've created this repository so that I can share the latest .deb file that actually works with everyone.

## Building and Packaging
If you'd like to package FreeCAD for ARM on your own, click [here](https://github.com/chunky-milk/freecad-rpi/blob/main/PACKAGE.md).

## Future Goals
I'm working on an automatic build system for this. If you'd like to assist please don't hesistate to message me on Discord: chunkymilk0309#3309.
