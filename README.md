# FreeCAD for Raspberry Pi

[![badge](https://github.com/Botspot/pi-apps/blob/master/icons/badge.png?raw=true)](https://github.com/Botspot/pi-apps)  

FreeCAD is a free and open-source parametric modeler. 

The original FreeCAD in the Raspberry Pi Foundation repositories is outdated. I've created this repository so that I can share the latest .deb file that actually works with everyone.

## Installing
Installing is quite easy, just download the latest .deb file [here](https://github.com/chunky-milk/freecad-rpi/releases/latest) and install it using **apt**. Or, just get it on [pi-apps](https://github.com/Botspot/pi-apps/).

## Building and Packaging
If you'd like to package FreeCAD for ARM on your own, click [here](https://github.com/chunky-milk/freecad-rpi/blob/main/PACKAGE.md).

## Future Goals
I'm working on an automatic build system for this. If you'd like to assist please don't hesistate to message me on Discord: chunkymilk0309#3309. Currently the only problem I have is that the deb file is too large to host myself.
